# Orchester · Agent Docs

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for every screen, feature and contract in the codebase.
> Optimized for AI agents (Claude Code, etc.) and new humans onboarding.

## Conventions for spec files

Every spec captures **two layers**: the initial Planning (designed before code)
and the Execution changelog (every meaningful change after).

```md
# <Name>

**Route(s):** /es/...
**File(s):** apps/web/app/[locale]/(shell)/.../page.tsx + components/...
**Owner:** product area (agents | flows | conversations | ...)
**Status:** alpha | beta | stable

## Purpose
1-2 sentences: what user problem it solves.

## Planning (initial design)

### Goals
### User flows
### Data
### Components
### Decisions & trade-offs

## Execution (changelog — newest first)

### YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- What changed
- Why
- Impact / trade-offs

## Performance notes
- Caching, queries, known costs

## Open issues / TODO
- ...
```

When changing code, **update the matching spec in the same commit**. PRs that
modify a screen without touching its spec are red flags.

## How to onboard a new agent

1. Read `architecture.md`.
2. Read the spec for the screen/feature you're touching.
3. Update the spec at the end of your change.
